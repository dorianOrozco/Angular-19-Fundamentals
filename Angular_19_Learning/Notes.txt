Starting the project can be done through the cli via command : ng s

<-- Standalone Components -->
In versions prior to Angular 14, creating a component would require it be declared in NgModule within the app.module.ts

Angular 14 and later, standalone components can be created and used independently. This means they do not need to be declared within.

Now, components can be created through the cli using  ng g c user (ng generate component (name)), these are known as standalone components. Again, these do not need to be declared.

For older projects you can convert components into standalone by adding the property standalone : true, then it must be removed from the ng declaration.

Angular version 19, standalone components are the default, thus no standalone property exists.

<!-- Component -->

@Component({
  selector: 'app-user',                   : Selector uses angular.json prefix to append before the component name (can be customized)
  imports: [],                            : Lists all required models and dependencies ex. CommonModule, FormsModule.. etc
  templateUrl: './user.component.html',   : Points to the HTML file for the component which defines the user interface view
  styleUrl: './user.component.scss'       : Points to the scss / css file for the component 
})

Whenever you want to import a component to a place such as the app component, you must type the component within the imports of the component.

For example, in app.component.ts
